Models properties / attributes

MVC: Model, View, Controller

### UML Data Diagrams

4 concepts:

- Entity (aka model / object) - draw a box
- Object name in the top - nouns
- Attributes (fixed pieces of data) in the middle
- Methods (calculations) at the bottom
- Relationships drawn between

Attributes are stored in memory / Methods are calculated by the CPU

When modeling, you are "defining the cookie cutters" - Evan
