## Object-Oriented Programming

### Models

Structured representations of data
Models properties / attributes

MVC: Model, View, Controller

### UML Data Diagrams

4 concepts:

- Entity (aka model / object) - draw a box
- Object name in the top - nouns
- Attributes (fixed pieces of data) in the middle
- Methods (calculations) at the bottom
- Relationships drawn between

Attributes are stored in memory / Methods are calculated by the CPU

"You're playing God" - Evan
When modeling, you are "defining the cookie cutters" - Evan
"We're looking at the _potential_ for things" - Turek
"One size fits all" - Mello
"One size fits all in that world" - Andy  <-- this is called a "Domain"
"Like building legos - data model diagrams are the instruction book" - Turek

#### Drawing

- Draw a tall-ish rectangle in the middle
- Add the title with a line beneath
- Draw a line near the bottom for methods

- Draw other rectangles round the edges
- Draw lines with either crow's feet or "1 - infinity-sign"

### Analyzing Domains

### Ruby Classes

### Controller / View Communication
