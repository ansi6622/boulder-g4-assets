## Warmup

Positivity

* Write down five positive things about yourself that is going to help you program today.
* Write down five positive things that you take for granted in your life.  
* Write down five positive things that have already happened today.
* Take five deep breaths and visualize your favorite thing from each list.

### Where are we?

1. Currently working through our first Rails CRUD
1. Next up: building Rails CRUD from scratch (users)
1. Then associations, validations
1. Then authentication / authorization
1. Then more CRUD (projects / memberships)

### Algorithm Practice

In pseudo-code (not actual ruby), generate an algorithm that will produce an
array that has every unique combination of:

* Age: 18-36
* Hair color: red, blonde, brown, black
* Eye color: green, brown, blue
* Height: 60"-80"

So the result would be something like:

```
[
  [18,"red hair","green eyes", "60 inches tall"],
  [18,"red hair","green eyes", "61 inches tall"],
  etc...
  [36,"black hair","blue eyes", "80 inches tall"],
]
```

## Solving the complete checkbox story

How did you do it?

## Flash

* Where should it go?
* How does it work?

## Query params

If the user sees `http://localhost:3000/?foo=bar`

In your controller, you access that with `params[:foo]`

If the user sees `http://localhost:3000/?foo=bar&status=aokay`

In your controller, you access that with `params[:foo]` and `params[:aokay]`

In a `link_to`, you can just add those parameters to your route name like `link_to "Foo bars", root_path(foo: "bar")`
