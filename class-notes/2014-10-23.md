## Warmup

Positivity

* Write down five positive things about yourself that is going to help you program today.
* Write down five positive things that you take for granted in your life.  
* Write down five positive things that have already happened today.
* Take five deep breaths and visualize your favorite thing from each list.

### Where are we?

1. Currently working through our first Rails CRUD
1. Next up: building Rails CRUD from scratch (users)
1. Then associations, validations
1. Then authentication / authorization
1. Then more CRUD (projects / memberships)

### Algorithm Practice

In pseudo-code (not actual ruby), generate an algorithm that will produce an
array that has every unique combination of:

* Age: 18-36
* Hair color: red, blonde, brown, black
* Eye color: green, brown, blue
* Height: 60"-80"

So the result would be something like:

```
[
  [18,"red hair","green eyes", "60 inches tall"],
  [18,"red hair","green eyes", "61 inches tall"],
  etc...
  [36,"black hair","blue eyes", "80 inches tall"],
]
```

## Flash

* Where should it go?
* How does it work?

Set the flash message by passing a notice to the `redirect_to some_path, notice: "some message"` call.

Display the flash message by using `<%= notice %>` in your view.

Flash messages are carried around in cookies.  

`redirect_to some_path, notice: "some message"` puts the the flash message in a cookie.

`<%= notice %>` reads the cookie, adds the message to the HTML, and deletes that message from the cookie


## Query params

If the user sees `http://localhost:3000/?foo=bar`

In your controller, you access that with `params[:foo]`

If the user sees `http://localhost:3000/?foo=bar&status=aokay`

In your controller, you access that with `params[:foo]` and `params[:aokay]`

In a `link_to`, you can just add those parameters to your route name like `link_to "Foo bars", root_path(foo: "bar")`

### Params exercise

```
cd ~/workspace/rails-active-record-practice/
```

By default, you should see all records.

Add 4 links - sort by first name, last name, eye color and birth date.

When you click any of those links, the page should be sorted by that field.

There should be a 5th link "only show awesome people".  When you click that link, it should filter out non-awesome people.

The controller will have something like:

```ruby
if params[:something]
  "apologize"
else
  "continue"
end
```

# gCamp Stories Filter Tasks

Add links to filter for *All Tasks* and *Incomplete Tasks* on index page.  The index page should default to *Incomplete Tasks*.

MVP Tracker Stories:

```
Current State,Estimate,Labels,Title,Description
unstarted,1,"mvp,filter",users can filter tasks on index page,"add link for *All Tasks*, *Incomplete Tasks*"
```

Tasks - add links for *All Tasks*, *Incomplete Tasks*. Index page should default to *Incomplete Tasks* and the *All* link should be clickable.

![Tasks - index](https://galvanize.mybalsamiq.com/mockups/2381087.png?key=dd6f91232218fa4d6cbf663738e10e0cfca3e151)


Tasks - *All* link should load all tasks. Now the *Incomplete* link is clickable.

![Tasks - index](https://galvanize.mybalsamiq.com/mockups/2381148.png?key=dd6f91232218fa4d6cbf663738e10e0cfca3e151)

Tasks - The *Incomplete* link will take you back to the index with only *Incomplete* tasks listed.
