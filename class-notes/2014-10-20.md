### We're using postgresql now

So....

When you create a new rails app, create it with `rails new <name> --database=postgresql`

### Databases

https://drive.google.com/a/galvanize.it/file/d/0B143NzKqlpeTVG9KdnNyZEY5OFk/view?usp=sharing

* Like excel spreadsheets, but more structured
* Databases have tables, tables have names
* Tables have columns, and columns have a name and a type (string, datetime, integer, boolean etc...)
* You add data to tables by inserting Rows, and Rows have auto-generated ids

Databases are files that live on a disk.  They are per-server, so you have one locally, and one in heroku.

You make changes to databases through migrations.  Migrations change the structure (schema) of a database.

### Migrations

* Download https://github.com/gSchool/rails-hack-params

You can see the schema of a database by looking in `db/schema.rb`

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 20141020144415) do

  # These are extensions that must be enabled in order to support this database
  enable_extension "plpgsql"

  create_table "users", force: true do |t|
    t.string  "name"
    t.string  "email"
    t.boolean "admin", default: false, null: false
  end

end
```

Version number / instructions

```ruby
class CreatePeople < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :people do |t|
      t.string :first_name
      t.string :last_name
      t.date :birth_date
      t.integer :favorite_number
    end
  end
end
```

```
jd-gschool:rails-hack-params galvanize$ rake db:migrate
== 20141020160741 CreatePeople: migrating =====================================
-- create_table(:people)
   -> 0.0039s
== 20141020160741 CreatePeople: migrated (0.0040s) ============================
```

You create migrations locally with `rails generate migration <some name>`

(all `rails generate` commands can be shortened to `rails g`)

You run migrations locally with `rake db:migrate`

You run migrations on heroku with `heroku run rake db:migrate`

The first time you either create an app, or install an app on your machine, you need to run `rake db:create`

2 commands you run at the terminal normally:

* `rails g migration <name>` (creates the file, creates a place to store the commands)
* `rake db:migrate` (runs it on your database, aka executes the commands)

The name of the database is stored in `config/database.yml`

```yaml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql

development:
  <<: *default
  database: rails-hack-params-development

```

Once you git push, don't change migrations evar.


When you download a rails app, you need to run:

```
bundle
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```

Whenever you git pull (or get updates to the app)

```
bundle
rake db:migrate
```

### Exercise

https://github.com/gSchool/rails-hack-params

```
cd ~/workspace
git clone git@github.com:gSchool/rails-hack-params.git
cd rails-hack-params
bundle
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rails s -p 3005
```

Users can add a date of birth field to users.

In the terminal:
```
rails g migration add_date_of_birth_to_users
```

NOTE: the name "add_date_of_birth_to_users" is just so later developers have an idea of what you did - they are like git commit messages.


Open Atom.

```
class AddDateOfBirthToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :users, :date_of_birth, :date
  end
end
```

Run `rake db:migrate`

### Convert gCamp from sqlite to postgres

```
cd ~/workspace/gcamp
atom .
```

Edit the `config/database.yml` and replace all contents with this:

```
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql

development:
  <<: *default
  database: gcamp_development

test:
  <<: *default
  database: gcamp_test

```

In Gemfile

* delete any line that has the word `sqlite3`
* move `pg` gem line out of the production block

```ruby
gem "pg"

group :production do
  gem "rails_12factor"
end
```

In the terminal: `rm db/development.sqlite3` and `rm db/test.sqlite3` (if they are there)

From the terminal:

```
bundle
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rails s -p 30xx
```

If that works...


```
git add -A
git commit -m "changed local database to postgres"
git push origin master
git push heroku master
```

### Params

#### How do params work?

**Exercise**

In `rails-hack-params` figure out:

* How to make the date of birth field show up on the form (the homepage)
* How to make the date of birth the user entered show up on the show page

What did you do to make it work?

How do you fill in these?

```
<%= f.label  ???  %>
<%= f.date_field  ???  %>
```

```
<%= f.label :column_name %>
<%= f.some_kind_of_field :column_name %>
```

So if it's a user with a date of birth, and you want to show a date field:

```
<%= f.label :date_of_birth %>
<%= f.date_field :date_of_birth %>
```

        <%= f.text_field :name, class: "form-control" %>

becomes

<input class="form-control" id="user_name" name="user[name]" type="text" />


Users see an actual text, when they fill it out, rails sees:

{"utf8"=>"âœ“", "authenticity_token"=>"ZCb7iJwoCL3mEkAERHJAOzuFUG8sn9HQXe9K794SHeY=", "user"=>{"name"=>"asdfasdf", "email"=>"asdfasdf@asdf.com", "date_of_birth"=>"2014-10-02"}, "commit"=>"Sign up!"}

Params are a representation of the data the user filled out in the browser, and the browser sent you.

* Why do we need strong params?

**Params Exercise**

Figure out (using only the chrome web inspector) a way to make admin users.

### gCamp Stories

Here's what you need to do:

* create a migration (`rails g migration add_something_to_some_table`)
* edit the migration file (google "rails guide migrations" to see available options)
* run `rake db:migrate`
* in Atom, edit the form (Add the form field.  Google "rails guides check_box" for more info)
* In the controller, add your field to the "strong params" (in this case, the `task_params` method in the tasks controller)
* be sure to show those fields somewhere

#### Complete Checkbox

Add a complete checkbox to your edit task page.
