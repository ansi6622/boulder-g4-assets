## Showing a single event

How do we allow users to show a single event?

### Showing event: describe

Objective:

You should be able to describe what gCamp is doing on the `/tasks/1` page

### Showing event: writing

Objective:

You should be able to be able to show a single event

* Added a link_to (go to rake routes, find the show line, grab the name, add `_path`)
* Created a controller action (just like edit / update - finds the record, sets an instance variable)
* Created a view print out (using `<%= %>`) the attributes from that object (row)

## Deleting an event

How do we allow users to delete data in our site?

## Exercise

On a notecard, draw wireframes.  Make sure to include:

* All of the links a user would need in order to show and destroy an event
* All of the form fields a user would need in order to show and destroy
* All of the urls that the user would see on the various pages
