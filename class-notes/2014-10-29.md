## Warmup

Knot tying - Emily

[Animated Knots by Grog](http://www.animatedknots.com/)

You should have in your "quiver":

* One end of line knot
  * Overhand
  * Figure 8
  * Ashley stopper
  * There are some other great ones
* One loop knot (preferably one end of line loop, one midline loop)
  * Bowline
  * Alpine Butterfly
* One knot that brings together two lines
  * Square (not to be trusted! no critical loads)
  * Sheet bend
  * Grapevine
  * Alpine Bend

## Showing a single event

How do we allow users to show a single event?

### Showing event: describe

Objective:

You should be able to describe what gCamp is doing on the `/tasks/1` page

### Showing event: writing

Objective:

You should be able to be able to show a single event

* Added a link_to (go to rake routes, find the show line, grab the name, add `_path`)
* Created a controller action (just like edit / update - finds the record, sets an instance variable)
* Created a view print out (using `<%= %>`) the attributes from that object (row)

## Deleting an event

How do we allow users to delete data in our site?

## Exercise

On a notecard, draw wireframes.  Make sure to include:

* All of the links a user would need in order to show and destroy an event
* All of the form fields a user would need in order to show and destroy
* All of the urls that the user would see on the various pages

# Destroy exercise

https://github.com/gSchool/rails-practice-crud-events

# Destroy flow

* Create a link (wherever is appropriate) with `method: :delete`
* Create the destroy action in your controller
* Add three things to the destroy action: find, destroy and redirect

If you want to confirm:

```
          <%= link_to "delete", event_path(event), method: :delete, data: {confirm: true} %>
```

# Goal:

Students should be able to CRUD an object by hand in a short amount of time (< 1 hour)

When you do rails new, use:

```
rails new my-app-name --database=postgresql
cd my-app-name
bundle
rake db:create
atom .
rails s
```

Do NOT put Bootstrap in these examples!
