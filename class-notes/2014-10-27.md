## CRUD without the scaffold generator

Question for the week: How do we allow users to manage data in our apps?

Question of the day:  How do we allow users to add records to our database, and see a list of those records?

## Exercise

Objective: Generate a list of things you'll need to do in order to implement the create / list features for CRUDing an Event.

Events have the following fields:

* Date (date)
* Location (string)
* Description (text)
* Capacity (integer)
* Requires ID (boolean)

## Exercise

https://github.com/gSchool/g4-crud-week4

Add the ability to add a new Event, and see a list of Events.  The user story would be:

`Users can see a list of events, and add an event to that list`

The objectives:

* Track your progress in a checklist
* Don't spend more than 10 minutes stuck on any step - ask for help / google
* Take baby steps - check the results in your browser after every small change
* Finish the story

No need to add twitter bootstrap.
