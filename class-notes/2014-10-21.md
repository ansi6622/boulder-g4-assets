## Warmup

Write down the steps you need to take to brush your teeth.  Be specific.

## Developer Algorithms

Algorithms are sets of instructions, that when executed, perform some task (achieve some result)

Characteristics:

* specific
* ordered
* have inputs
* they cover the base case and all other cases
* they have variables / account for variation
* we start them specifically (with a known set) and _then_ generalize
* there's no single "right answer" - but there are lots of wrong answers - you'll have to evaluate pros / cons
