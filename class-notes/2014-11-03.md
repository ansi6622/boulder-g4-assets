## Warmup
Go to your favorite website.  

* Look at it in detail, from a programmer's perspective.
* What things could program?
* If you wrote it in rails what models would you need?
* What things if any would not be possible yet?


# Week 5!

## Central question

How do we identify which user is using our app?

## Unit overview

* Learn how to write tests
* Learn about sessions / cookies
* Figure out how to use sessions to identify users
* Build user auth in class
* Add user auth to gCamp

## Testing with RSpec / Capybara

### Configure RSpec

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

* Install and configure RSpec in your project
* Run all specs in your project## RSpec installation exercise

Add a group to your Gemfile that looks like this:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
end
```

(You just changed your Gemfile, so `bundle`)

From the terminal, cd into your rails root and run `rails g rspec:install`

From the terminal, run `rspec` and it will run any specs you have written.

You should see something like:

```
No examples found.

```

### Intro to Capybara

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

* Install Capybara
* Write a capybara spec
* Debug your capybara spec with `save_and_open_page`

#### Capybara Activity

1. cd into `~/workspace/rails-practice-add-rspec` (or download it from https://github.com/gSchool/rails-practice-add-rspec)
1. In the `:development, :test` section of your Gemfile, add `gem "capybara"` and `gem 'launchy'` then `bundle`
1. In  `spec/rails_helper.rb`, underneath `require 'rspec/rails'`, add `require 'capybara/rails'`
1. Make a directory called `spec/features`
1. Make a file named `spec/features/events_spec.rb`
1. Edit `events_spec.rb` - the first line of the file should be `require 'rails_helper'`
1. Add your feature and scenario according to https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#using-capybara-with-rspec (use the feature / scenario example)
1. Run your feature with `rspec spec/features/events_spec.rb ` from the command line (in your rails root directory)

Debugging:

1. When you want to see what your spec sees, type `save_and_open_page`
