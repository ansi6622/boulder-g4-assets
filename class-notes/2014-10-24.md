## Warmup

* Close your computer and draw the file structure of Rails from memory.  After 5 minutes, look and see how close you got.

## Representing Time Data Model Practice

Remember UML?

```
**************
* ObjectName *
**************
* Attributes *
*            *
*            *
*            *
**************
* Methods    *
*            *
**************
```

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Identify potential classes, attributes and methods based on user stories
* Draw a UML diagram including those classes, attributes, methods and relationships

Model an apartment building:

```
Users want to be able to see a list of the apartments on all floors
Users want to be able to see details about an apartment, such as # of bedrooms, # of bathrooms and square footage
Users want to be able to see which apartments are vacant
Users want to be able to see a list of all tenants listed on every lease (current and previous) for an apartment
Users want to be able to see a list of rent checks, when they were received and deposited
Users want to be able to see how much each apartment has made
Users want to be able to see the total amount of money they've taken in for a given apartment
