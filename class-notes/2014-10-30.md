## Announcements

The Computer Science Education Week planning committee could use some help putting together a simple landing page with a list of events and links to find out more about individual events.

Any interest?

## Morning

How do we represent the complexity of CRUD in sequence diagrams?

## Sequence diagrams

Objective:

You should be able to represent the flow of data in a request, including things like:

* redirects
* requests with params
* method calls w/ arguments
* urls / http verbs

Demo with Laptop as an example.

Story

```
A user makes a get request to /parties/new
The controller sets an instance variable called @party and renders a view
The user fill out fields for name and location
When the user clicks submit, it makes a post request to /parties, which sends the name and location params
The controller calls the create method on the Party model, and passes the the name and location
The Party model inserts a row into the database, and the database returns the id that was generated (id 1)
The server redirects their browser to /parties/1
```

## CRUD Sequence Diagrams

Objective:

You should be able to represent the following flows in sequence diagrams:

* index
* new / create / [show or index]
* edit / update / [show or index]
* destroy / index

## Priorities

* CRUD practice
* Rejected / unfinished MVP stories
* Personal project progress
* Previous stretch stories (https://github.com/gSchool/gcamp-assets) - especially pagination w/ filtering
* Blogging

## ~4pm

* Enter blog urls
