### Algorithm Practice

In pseudo-code (not actual ruby), generate an algorithm that will produce an
array that has every unique combination of:

* Age: 18-36
* Hair color: red, blonde, brown, black
* Eye color: green, brown, blue
* Height: 60"-80"

So the result would be something like:

```
[
  [18,"red hair","green eyes", "60 inches tall"],
  [18,"red hair","green eyes", "61 inches tall"],
  etc...
  [36,"black hair","blue eyes", "80 inches tall"],
]
```

### Remembering Database Things

### ActiveRecord Creating

Purpose: understanding what the `TasksController` is doing.

Assume you have an ActiveRecord model called Car with attributes of `make`, `model` and `year`

The following techniques produce the same result.

#### Technique #1

Using `new`, setting attributes, calling `.save`

```ruby
car = Car.new
car.make = "Chevy"
car.model = "Tracker"
car.year = 2012
car.save
```

#### Technique #2

Using `new` with a hash, then calling `.save`

```ruby
car = Car.new(make: "Chevy", model: "Tracker", year: 2012)
car.save
```

NOTE: the following are all different syntax for the same thing:

```ruby
car = Car.new({make: "Chevy", model: "Tracker", year: 2012})

car = Car.new make: "Chevy", model: "Tracker", year: 2012

car = Car.new :make => "Chevy", :model => "Tracker", :year => 2012

car = Car.new(:make => "Chevy", :model => "Tracker", :year => 2012)
```

#### Technique #3

Using `.create`

```ruby
car = Car.create({make: "Chevy", model: "Tracker", year: 2012})
```

### ActiveRecord Creation Exercise

Run your "download app" algorithm, which should look like this:

```
cd ~/workspace
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
bundle
rake db:create db:migrate
```

In this case, the repo is located at: https://github.com/gSchool/rails-active-record-practice

- In the `db/seeds.rb` file, write a script that will create 9 people.
- Each person should have a unique name
- Use each of the 3 methods to create people (experiment with different syntaxes)
- Test your file by running `rake db:seed`

### ActiveRecord Finding

#### Finding all records

```ruby
Car.all
```

#### Finding a single record

```ruby
Car.find(1)
```

#### Filtering records

```ruby
Car.where(make: "Chevy")
```

#### Ordering records

```ruby
Car.order(:make)
```

#### Chaining methods

```ruby
Car.where(make: "Chevy").order(:year)
```

### ActiveRecord Creation Exercise

In the same repo as above (rails-active-record-practice):

- order by first name
- filter so only awesome people are shown
- filter so only people with green eyes are shown
